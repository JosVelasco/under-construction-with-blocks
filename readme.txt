== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/under-construction-with-blocks` or install through WordPress admin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen
3. That's it! The maintenance page is now live for visitors
4. To customize the page, go to Pages > All Pages and edit "Under Construction"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I customize the maintenance page? =

Go to Pages > All Pages in your WordPress admin and click "Edit" on the "Under Construction" page. You can change the text, add images, modify colors, and rearrange the layout using the block editor - just like editing any other page.

= Can I preview what visitors see? =

Yes! Either log out of WordPress or open a private/incognito browser window to see exactly what your visitors see.

= Will this affect my website permanently? =

Not at all. When you deactivate the plugin, your website returns to normal immediately. The maintenance page becomes hidden (saved as a draft) but isn't deleted, so you can reactivate the plugin anytime.

= Can I still access my admin area? =

Absolutely. You and anyone else who is logged in can access everything normally - the admin area, your regular pages, everything. Only visitors who aren't logged in see the maintenance page.

= What about search engines? =

The plugin tells search engines not to index the maintenance page, so it won't hurt your SEO. When you deactivate it, your normal site pages will be crawled again.

= Do I need to know any code? =

Nope! Everything works automatically. If you want to customize the page, you can do it through the familiar WordPress page editor without touching any code.
